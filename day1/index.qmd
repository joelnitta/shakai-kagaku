## What is biodiversity?

- **The different kinds of life that occur on our planet**

. . .

- Often we talk about the **number of species**, but it has other definitions too

## Why does biodiversity matter?

1. How would you feel if you could **never visit a natural place** like a forest or the mountains?

## Biodiversity has inherent value

- Biodiversity has **inherent value**: it is worth something **just by existing**

- Biodiversity has **cultural value**: we derive **inspiration** from it

1. How would you feel if you **couldn't eat any fruit** because there were no bees to pollinate flowers?

## Why does biodiversity matter?

- Biodiversity provides **ecosystem services**: humans benefit from the natural environment

## Biodiversity is **in danger**

We will learn about the **specific risks** posed to biodiversity, and **actionable measures** to counteract them.

## Outline: Day 1

- Global distribution of biodiversity
- Levels of biodiversity
- Threats to biodiversity
- Protecting biodiversity
- Quiz

## Outline Day 2

- Introduction to iNaturalist
- Survey of Chiba University biodiversity
- Analysis of survey results
- Quiz

## What is biodiversity?

- **The different kinds of life that occur on our planet**

To understand biodiversity, we need to **document** it (describe where it occurs)

## How can we count (quantify) life?

## Species richness

![](../images/richness.png)

The **number of species** 種数

## Population size (abundance)

![](../images/abundance.png)

The **number of individuals** belonging to a species 個体数

## Biomass

![](../images/biomass.png)

The **total mass** of organisms 生物量

## Counting life

- Richness: The number of species 種数

- Population size (abundance): The number of individuals belonging to a species 個体数

- Biomass: The total mass of organisms 生物量

## Activity: Which is more diverse?

## Species richness is often used, but is not the only way to measure biodiversity

There is no single definition of diversity.

How you measure it depends on your goal and the data available

## Species richness is unevenly distributed

Some areas have **many** species, others have **few**.

## Latitudinal species gradient

The number of species **increases** going **from the poles to the equator**

- latitude = 緯度
- equator = 赤道

## Latitudinal species gradient

## There are many factors that determine richness

- Climate 気候
- Biotic interactions 生物間相互作用
- Evolution 進化
- Humans

These affect ranges of individual species, **and** species richness

## Hotspots are areas of exceptionally high richness

Hotspots have high richness **and** are in danger: these are the areas that we should focus on conserving

- 種の数が極めて多い
- すでにダメージを受けている

## 35 Global Biodiversity Hotspots

## Activity: How do you experience biodiversity?

In your group, discuss:

- Where do you see/experience areas of **high** biodiversity?

- Where do you see/experience areas of **low** biodiversity?

- **Why** do you think there is a difference?
